IMPORTANT: For the moment, it *will only work with a sqlite database*. Create, 
fill and submit a "install/<yourdb>.initial.sql" file to enable other backends.

The plugin requires its own db table, thats why, you should run the
install/index.php script once before enabling the plugin.

Then, each user can enable or disable the plugin in its settings
pane.
