Installing automatic addressbook plugin
---------------------------------------

You need roundcube 0.4, 0.5 or 0.6 installed.
Download the latest version archive

1. Uncompress it and move it to the roundcube plugins dir :

    tar xvjf automatic_addressbook-latest.tar.bz2
    mv rc_plugins/automatic_addressbook <path_to_roundcube>/plugins/

2. Execute the relevant SQL/<db engine>.initial.sql script on your database (process depends on your DB engine)

3. Add "automatic_addressbook" to the plugins list in <path_to_roundcube>/config/main.inc.php, for example :

    $rcmail_config['plugins'] = array('automatic_addressbook',);

It works :)


Configuration
-------------

You can customize some settings :

    copy config/config.inc.php.dist to config/config.inc.php
    edit config/config.inc.php as you fancy

Among others, you can choose if your users will have automatic_addressbook enabled or disabled by default (use_auto_abook option).


Upgrading roundcube to 0.6
--------------------------

If you upgrade from roundcube 0.5 to 0.6, automatic addressbook plugin will continue to work :

    Be sure to use the last version of the plugin ;
    upgrade the plugin's database schemes using one of the automatic_addressbook/SQL/*.update.sql scripts.
